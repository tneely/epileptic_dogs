"It’s the variability that really makes it so stress-
ful. You never know when it is going to be chaos
again and you’ll have one. Just because this morn-
ing is terrific doesn’t mean tonight is going to be
terrific, either behavior-wise, medication-wise, or any
other-wise. So it is the unpredictability of it that is
really nerve-racking to live with.""
