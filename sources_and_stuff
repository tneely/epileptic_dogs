"It’s the variability that really makes it so stress-
ful. You never know when it is going to be chaos
again and you’ll have one. Just because this morn-
ing is terrific doesn’t mean tonight is going to be
terrific, either behavior-wise, medication-wise, or any
other-wise. So it is the unpredictability of it that is
really nerve-racking to live with.""

epilepsy, Seizure 2 (1993) 167–178

"However, from the clinical point of view, no
significative practical advance has been verified: there is not any system usable
by patients allowing them to predict a coming seizure and to take action to
preserve his (her) safety and privacy, improving substantially his (her) social
integration. This is probably because most of the researchers look for a general
method and algorithm that would work for every patient. And although several
authors propose methods to which they claim a high performance, the considered
performance criteria is only partial, neglecting other parts of the problem that
prevent them to be used in a clinical environment."
